# Dummy-Group24

## Overview
This project is a **client-server** implemented in Java. It is designed to **allow users to communicate**, featuring **client-server communication, concurrency handling, and data processing** to achieve **[specific goal]**.

## Features
The project includes the following functionalities:
- ✅ **[Feature 1]** (e.g., Multi-threaded server to handle multiple clients concurrently)
- ✅ **[Feature 2]** (e.g., Secure data transfer using Java Sockets)
- ✅ **[Feature 3]** (e.g., Persistent storage using MySQL/SQLite)
- ✅ **[Feature 4]** (e.g., User authentication and role-based access)
- ❌ **[Unimplemented Feature]** (if applicable)

## Technologies Used
- **Java (JDK 17+)**
- **Maven/Gradle** (for dependency management)
- **MySQL/SQLite** (for data storage)
- **JUnit** (for testing)
- **Spring Boot / Java Sockets** (if applicable)
- **Logging (SLF4J / Log4j)**

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **JDK 17+** installed:
  ```sh
  java -version

    Install Maven (if using Maven) or Gradle (if using Gradle).

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git
cd projectname

Build the Project
Using Maven

mvn clean install

Using Gradle

./gradlew build

Run the Application
Running the Server

java -cp target/projectname.jar com.project.Server

Running the Client

java -cp target/projectname.jar com.project.Client

Configuration

The project can be configured using a config.properties file. Below is an example:

server.port=8080
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/projectdb
database.username=root
database.password=yourpassword

Modify these settings according to your environment before running the project.
Usage
Running the Server

    Navigate to the project directory.
    Run the server:

    java -jar target/projectname.jar

    The server should now be running on localhost:8080.

Running the Client

    Ensure the server is running.
    Execute:

    java -cp target/projectname.jar com.project.Client

    The client should connect to the server successfully.

Experiments Conducted

    Performance Benchmarking
        Hypothesis: The system can handle 100 concurrent connections without significant degradation.
        Experiment: Simulated 100 clients connecting to the server and measured response time.
        Results: Average response time remained under 200ms, but minor delays were observed after 150 clients.

    Concurrency Handling
        Hypothesis: The server should not crash when multiple clients send simultaneous requests.
        Experiment: Stress-tested the server with rapid incoming requests.
        Results: No crashes observed, but some data packets were delayed due to queue congestion.

    Error Recovery Testing
        Hypothesis: The system should recover from network failures within 5 seconds.
        Experiment: Disconnected and reconnected a client multiple times.
        Results: The system reconnected successfully, but with a 3-second delay in some cases.

Issues Encountered

    Concurrency Bottlenecks: Found that using synchronized methods in Java caused slowdowns. Resolved using Java’s ExecutorService for thread management.
    Database Locking Issues: When multiple clients attempted simultaneous writes, some operations were delayed. Fixed using transaction management.
    Handling Large Data Packets: When sending large files over sockets, packet loss was observed. Solved by implementing chunked data transmission.

Design Decisions

    Multi-threaded architecture: The server runs multiple threads to handle simultaneous client requests efficiently.
    Asynchronous Logging: Using SLF4J with Log4j to improve debugging without performance overhead.
    Modular Code Structure: Divided functionality into controllers, models, and utilities for better maintainability.

Future Improvements

    Implement load balancing to handle high traffic.
    Add encryption for secure data transfer.
    Improve error logging to provide detailed diagnostics.
